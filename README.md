# weather-app
This is my first weather app. Lots of improvements and future features are planned.


This purpose of this application is to connect to an open weather api and make AJAX calls for each city/location that is searched up.  The returning results will show the currently weather conditions, such as UV index, temperature, and humidity.
Other future features will include a more organized layout, streamlined results display, and more weather information.
